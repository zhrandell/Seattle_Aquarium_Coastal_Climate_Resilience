# Seattle_Aquarium_Coastal_Climate_Resilience

## Overview 
This is a public repository to organize information and resources pertaining to the Seattle Aquarium's **Coastal Climate Resilience** (CCR) program. 
Specifically, we have developed and implemented standardized methods to use small remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to conduct video/photo surveys along relatively shallow coastal areas (5-40m depth), especially along canopy-forming and understory kelp forest locations. 
We envision fully integrating ROVs as another tool in the coastal ecologists' toolkit that can (among other missions) complement and enhance existing long-term subtidal monitoring programs.

**Our objectives:** 
* **1.** Expand the spatial extent (seafloor area) across which we gather high-resolution photo/video imagery.
  
* **2.** Use open-source AI methods of image analysis to efficiently extract large amounts of data from our imagery. 
  
* **3.** Conduct data analysis to better understand the patterns of population health and ecological resilience for kelp, invertebrates, and fishes. 
  
* **4.** Integrate these ROV-derived data with other sources of information such as data from scuba divers, fixed sensors, autonomous surface vessels (ASVs), drones, and satellite imagery, in order to maximize our inferences about benthic community structure, stability, and resilience.
  
* **5.** We commit to pursue **1.** - **4.** in an open-source, open-access manner such that our partners, collaborators, and the public can replicate what we've started in order to advance their own coastal monitoring, conservation, restoration, and management objectives. We likewise commit to actively support our partners in the development of their own ROV programs. Similar to the broad geographic reach of the standardized protocols set down by scientific diving programs such as Reef Check and PISCO, we envision a network of collaborators using standardized ROV survey protocols to enhance our collective data collection, analysis, and coordination capacity.

The purpose of this repo is to make general and introductory information about the CCR program accessible to our partners, collaborators, and the public. 
All information and documentation associated with the repo is freely available to download and share. 
We welcome collaborators and partners, as well as feedback, comments, and questions. Please direct contact to z.randell@seattleaquarium.org
